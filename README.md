## Useful pod commands
* Installation.
```
>>> pod init
```
* Downloads all dependencies defined in Podfile and creates an Xcode Pods library project in ./Pods.
```
>>> pod install
```
* Updates the Pods identified by the specified POD_NAMES, which is a space-delimited list of pod names. If no POD_NAMES are specified, it updates all the Pods, ignoring the contents of the Podfile.lock. This command is reserved for the update of dependencies; pod install should be used to install changes to the Podfile.
```
>>> pod update [POD_NAMES ...]
```
* Shows the outdated pods in the current Podfile.lock, but only those from spec repos, not those from local/external sources.
```
>>> pod outdated
```
* Deintegrate your project from CocoaPods. Removing all traces of CocoaPods from your Xcode project.
```
>>> pod deintegrate
```
